0,We broke up a month ago Your friends are mine you know I know You've moved on found someone new One more girl who brings out the better in you And I thought my heart was detached From all the sunlight of our past But she's so sweet she's so pretty Does she mean you forgot about me?  Oh I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish I know I can't let you go So find someone great but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier  And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me? And now I'm pickin' her apart Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart But she's beautiful she looks kind She probably gives you butterflies You might also like I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish I know I can't let you go So find someone great but don't find no one better I hope you're happy I wish you all the best really Say you love her baby just not like you loved me And think of me fondly when your hands are on her I hope you're happy but don't be happier  Ooh ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh  I hope you're happy Just not like how you were with me I'm selfish I know can't let you go So find someone great but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier

33,Ooh yeah (Ooh) (Come on come on)  I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself? I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare First ship em dope and let em deal to brothers Give em guns step back watch em kill each other It's time to fight back that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark now Huey's dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?

It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh yeah) Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts givin' it back to you (Ooh) Don't let em jack you up back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh) And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back Cause I always got to worry bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin' back after all these years Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is (Uh) That's just the way it is (Just the way it is yeah yeah yeah) Things'll never be the same (Yeah) That's just the way it is (The way it is) Aww yeah (Some things will never change oh my) (I'm tryna make a change) (You're my brother you're my sister yeah) That's just the way it is (The way it is the way it is) Things'll never be the same (You're my brother you're my sister) That's just the way it is aww yeah Some things'll never change3
